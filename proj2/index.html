		<h1>Overview</h1>
		<h1>Task 1</h1>
			<p>De Casteljau's algorithm is the process by which multiple points are evaluated to produce a final point that lies on the corresponding Bezier curve.
				It does so by recursively linearly interpolating between the points p(1) - p(n), producing the vector p(1)' - p(n-1)'.
				In the final iteration a point on the Bezier curve is returned.</p>
			<p>I implemented de Casteljau's algorithm by looping through the points provided, linearly interpolating between the point and the next point using the parameter t.
				I then pushed these linear interpolations onto a return vector, which consisted of a vector of points with size = original vector.size() - 1.
				Finally if there is only one point provided, I return that point. </p>

		<p>Changing the parameter t lets us view different points lying on the final Bezier curve.
			With a smaller t value the final returned point is closer to the start of the curve, a larger t value returns a point near the end of the curve.

		<h1>Task 2</h1>
			<p>De Casteljau's algorithm extends to Bezier sufaces through evaluation in two steps.
				The first step is to perform the standard algorithm over the vertical lines in the surface(the rows of the 2D matrix).
				Looping through this lines will return a set of points that comprise a horizontal curve on the surface.
				Applying de Casteljau's algorithm to this set of points will return a point lying on the Bezier surface.
			<p>I implemented this algorithm by using the three functions provided. In evaluateStep() the function is similar to the 1D algorithm,
				returning a vector of points linearly interpolated using the given points and the parameter t.
				Evaluate1D() is used as a helper function that passes in the points assigned by evaluate(), and returns a final point lying on the Bezier curve.
				Evaluate() first loops through each row of the 2D matrix and calls evaluate1D() on the row. The parameter u is used to linearly interpolate.
				Each of the points returned by this loop is pushed onto a vector of final points. I then call evaluate1D() on this vector, returning the final point on the Bezier surface.</p>

		<h1>Task 3</h1>
			<p>I implemented area-weighted vertex normals by first setting 2 counters, a Vector3D sum and the intiial halfedge.
				The Vector3D sum is used to keep track of the summed cross product of each neighbouring triangle.
				I then traversed through the mesh using the initial halfedge as a stopping condition.
			</p>
			<p>On each cycle I used halfedge traversal to determine the three points that comprised the neighbouring triangle.
				I then calculated two vectors v1 = p2 - p1 and v0 = p1 - p0. I normalized the cross product of these vectors(cross(v0,v1) / cross(v0,v1).norm()) and added the result to the running sum.
				Finally I normalized the sum by setting it equal to sum / sum.norm() and returned it.</p>

		<h1>Task 4</h1>
			<p>I implemented edge flips by first checking if the edge is a boundary edge. If it is I return immediately.
				Else, I label each of the components in the two triangles. These are the 10 halfedges, 4 vertices, 2 faces, and 5 edges.
				After obtaining this information I set each of the vertices, faces, and edges to a corresponding halfedge.
				Finally I set the halfedge's neighbors according to the diagram below.</p>
			<p>The halfedges on the outside of the two triangles do not have their next halfedge and face change, so I set their parameters equal to h->next() and h->face().</p>
			<p>I didn't encounter any significant bugs while implementing this function. The hardest part of flipping correctly was ensuring that each component in the triangles are set properly.
				Sketching the two triangles and listing the components before and after the flip helped with visualizing the problem.</p>

		<h1>Task 5</h1>
			<p>I implemented edge splits similarly to edge flips. First I gathered information about the existing faces, edges, etc.
				I then defined the new components created by an edge split. These were the 6 new halfedges, 3 edges, 2 faces, and 1 vertex.</p>
			<p>I then calculated the position of the new vertex by taking the average of the two vertex positions lying on the edge provided.
				Finally I assigned the new values to each object according to the diagram below.</p>
			<p>I also did not experience any major roadblocks while implementing edge splits.
				Drawing the triangles before and after the split helped tremendously in cataloging each component and ensuring the correct halfedge/neighbour was assigned.</p>

    <h1>Task 6</h1>
			<p>To implement loop subdivision, first I looped through the existing edges to calculate the vertex position for each edge.
				I also assigned each edge's isNew boolean to false. I then looped through the vertices and calculated the new position for each vertex.
				These values were assigned to the edge/vertex newPosition.
				I also set each existing vertex isNew boolean to false.</p>
			<p>I then split each edge, making sure to assign isNew to true for each new edge. I also assigned isOriginal for the two edges that were in the original mesh.
				I flipped the edges that had isNew set to true and isOriginal set to false.
				Finally I looped through all the vertices and assigned their position to newPosition.</p>
			<p>A significant trick I used while implementing this function was adding a boolean to the edge class: isOriginal.
				I added this boolean because while isNew can keep track of the edges generated by each call to edgeSplit(),
				it does not keep track of whether or not that edge comprised the original mesh's structure.
				This extra information was helpful while calling edgeSplit() and edgeFlip(). In edgeSplit() I could make sure the current edge is not new,
				and in edgeFlip() I could check to see if the edge is part of the original mesh or not.</p>
			<p>After multiple loop subdivisions the general shape of the object remains the same.
				This is because averaging the nearby vertices to determine the new vertex's position allows the mesh to retain its original shape.
				Averaging these vertices also causes sharp edges to "round" as shown by the torus after two upsamples.
			  The rounding is caused by the linear interpolations, similar to how the final Bezier curve is returned.
				The only difference is that each upsampling undergoes only one iteration of de Casteljau's algorithm</p>

			<p>To shape out the irregularities in the cube afer loop subdivison I first split each side so that it would have 4 triangles in an "X" formation.
				After upsampling the irregularities in the cube were less noticable, more akin to a sphere.
				I think the pre-splitting helped guide the upsampling towards a regular object.
				In the original cube there is not much information to use during each upsampling. In addition each side of the cube is not symmetric and is split in an alternating fashion.
				Pre-splitting the cube caused it to be symmetric, meaning each new vertex used nearby positions that were equidistant.</p>

			<p>I experiences some significant bugs while implementing loop subdivision.</p>
			<p>One bug I encountered caused each vertex to disappear, with the edges all pointing to the origin.
				This was caused while calculating the new vertex position. In my vertex formula I included the division (1/8) and (3/8),
				but for some reason my compiler treated the result as an integer, rounding down the result to zero.
				I solved this bug by explicitly casting the divisions to a float type.</p>
			<p>Another bug I encountered was the upsampling forming a strange shape after the second iteration.
				This was due to me forgetting to reset the isNew values in the first edge loop to false, causing each iteration after the first to ignore parts of the mesh.
				Setting isNew in the edge loop resolved this bug.</p>
